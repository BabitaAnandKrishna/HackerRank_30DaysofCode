Objective
Today, we're working with binary numbers. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given a base-10 integer, n, convert it to binary (base-2). Then find and print the base-10 integer denoting the maximum number of consecutive 1's in n's binary representation.

Input Format

A single integer, n.


Explanation

Sample Case 1:
The binary representation of  5 is 101, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1.

Sample Case 2:
The binary representation of 13 is 1101, so the maximum number of consecutive 1's is 2.
