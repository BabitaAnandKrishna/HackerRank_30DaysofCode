Objective
Today's challenge puts your understanding of nested conditional statements to the test. You already have the knowledge to complete this challenge,
but check out the Tutorial tab for a video on testing!

Task
Your local library needs your help! Given the expected and actual return dates for a library book, create a program that calculates the fine (if any). The fee structure is as follows:

If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged (i.e.: fine=0).
If the book is returned after the expected return day but still within the same calendar month and year as the expected return date,fine = 15Hackos *(the number of days late) .
If the book is returned after the expected return month but still within the same calendar year as the expected return date, the  fine = 500Hackos *(the number of months late).
If the book is returned after the calendar year in which it was expected, there is a fixed fine of 10000 Hackos .
Input Format

The first line contains 3 space-separated integers denoting the respective day,month , and year on which the book was actually returned.
The second line contains  space-separated integers denoting the respective day,month , and year on which the book was expected to be returned (due date).

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
d, m, y = map(int, list(input().split(' ')))
de, me, ye = map(int, list(input().split(' ')))

fine = 0

if y > ye:
    fine = 10000
elif y == ye:
    if m > me:
        fine = 500 * (m - me)
    elif m == me:
        if d > de:
            fine = 15 * (d - de)  
            
print(fine)
