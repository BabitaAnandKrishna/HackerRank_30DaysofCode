Objective
Welcome to the last day! Today, we're discussing bitwise operations. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Task
Given set S={1,2,3,.....,N}. Find two integers,A  and B (where A<B), from set S such that the value of A&B is the maximum possible and also less than a given integer, .
In this case,  represents the bitwise AND operator.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,T , the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines defines a test case as 2 space-separated integers, N and K, respectively.

Sample Input
