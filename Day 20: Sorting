Objective
Today, we're discussing a simple sorting algorithm called Bubble Sort. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

Consider the following version of Bubble Sort:

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    // Track number of elements swapped during a single array traversal
    int numberOfSwaps = 0;
    
    for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
        // Swap adjacent elements if they are in decreasing order
        if (a[j] > a[j + 1]) {
            swap(a[j], a[j + 1]);
            numberOfSwaps++;
        }
    }
    
    // If no elements were swapped during a traversal, array is sorted
    if (numberOfSwaps == 0) {
        break;
    }
}
Task
Given an array,a , of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following  lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement
where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement
where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,n , denoting the number of elements in array a.
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of a0,a1,a2,........,an-1.

Constraints
2<=n<=600
1<=ai<-2*10^6, where 0<=i<=n .
Output Format

Print the following three lines of output:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement
where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement
where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Sample Input 0

3
1 2 3
Sample Output 0

Array is sorted in 0 swaps.
First Element: 1
Last Element: 3
