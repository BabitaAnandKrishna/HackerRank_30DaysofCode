Task
A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Given a number,n , determine and print whether it's Prime or Not prime.

Note: If possible, try to come up with a O(square root of n) primality algorithm, or see what sort of optimizations you come up with for an O()n algorithm.
Be sure to check out the Editorial after submitting your code!

Input Format

The first line contains an integer,T , the number of test cases.
Each of the T subsequent lines contains an integer, n, to be tested for primality.

# Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT

for _ in range(int(input())):
    num = int(input())
    if(num == 1):
        print("Not prime")
    else:
        if(num % 2 == 0 and num > 2):
            print("Not prime")
        else:
            for i in range(3, int(num**(1/2))+1, 2):
                if num % i == 0:
                    print("Not prime")
                    break
